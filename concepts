Considering pieces in chess, considering their value is linked to the space they on, means that pieces in their essence are built on two fundamental concepts: 
- the cell control
- the mobility
In this file we are going to describe the process to calculate the value of piece when the space (chessboard) is empty.

To calculate the value of a piece we proceed as follow:
   1) pawn
      a) Determination of the ACC or Average Cell Control
         A pawn is a pawn on 48 cells, first row and last row are not counted: it is not a pawn. 
         6 rows x 8 columns = 48 cells
         on the first and last column; on each cell the pawn occupy, it controls one cell
         on the other cells, it controls 2 cells.
         Let's sum all the cells controlled--> (6x2)+(12x6) = 84
         Let's divide this number by the number of the cells occupied (48)
         84:48 = 1.75 >> The Average Cell Control (ACC)
         The ACC of the pawn is 1.75
      b) Determination of the PM or Piece Mobility
         A pawn is a pawn on 48 cells, first row and last row are not counted: it is not a pawn.  
         On the second row, pawns of the first and last column, can move (in one move) in three directions (two, straight on, and one taking aside an enemy piece)
